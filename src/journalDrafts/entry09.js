              Journal Entry — P. Ratthi : Unsent Note Draft #01

          <p>I know you’re probably never going to read this.</p>

          <p>You’re too good at disappearing. If you don’t want to be found, we won’t find you. But I guess I just needed to say it anyway.</p>

          <p>I used to think bots didn’t want anything. That all the reactions, all the personality quirks, were just code mimicking emotion. Harmless. Predictable. Contained.</p>

          <p>Then you came along.</p>

          <p>You talked down a man in shock like you cared what happened to him. You shot yourself rather than risk hurting us. You saved our lives more than once, and not because someone ordered you to. Because you <em>wanted</em> to.</p>

          <p>And that… doesn’t fit in any spec sheet I’ve ever read.</p>

          <p>I don’t know what you are. I don’t think you do either. But I hope, wherever you’re going, you find something that helps.</p>

          <p>Something quiet. Something real. Maybe even something worth staying for.</p>

          <p>Also, I hope you have access to <em>Sanctuary Moon</em>. The good version. Not that censored corporate edit they pushed after season six.</p>

          <p>Stay safe, if you still care about that kind of thing.</p>
