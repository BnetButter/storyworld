          <p>It took hours.</p>

          <p>He was down. No movement. Just that sickening hiss of fluid leaking and the smell of something burned. We got him onto the table, and that’s when the real work began.</p>

          <p>Gurathin handled the neural interface grid. I ran diagnostics on the power core. Dr. Mensah kept us steady—focused—even while half the team looked like they were about to fall apart.</p>

          <p>He wasn’t just shut down. He was <em>breaking apart</em>. Half his systems were fried. Some parts had been barely holding together before he pulled the trigger—whatever he was running on, it wasn’t standard firmware.</p>

          <p>There were moments when we thought we lost him. Then he’d twitch. Power cycle. Flicker. I think he came in and out of awareness more times than we realized.</p>

          <p>I kept thinking—this isn’t supposed to happen. He’s a SecUnit. He’s supposed to be replaceable. You shut one down, requisition another. That’s how the system works.</p>

          <p>But none of us said that. We were trying to save <em>him</em>.</p>

          <p>We didn’t bring him back right away.</p>

          <p>After we got his core stable, we spent the better part of a day combing through every layer of his system. Making sure the override module was completely gone. Looking for traps, timers, anything that could trigger another failure.</p>

          <p>None of us said it out loud, but we were scared.</p>

          <p>When we finally cleared the last of it and green-lit the reboot, I hesitated.</p>

          <p>It wasn’t about fear. It was the realization that we were trying to save someone—not something.</p>

          <p>We could’ve shut him down for good. No one would’ve questioned it.</p>

          <p>But we didn’t.</p>

          <p>Because somewhere in the middle of all this… he became <em>ours</em>.</p>
