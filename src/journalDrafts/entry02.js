    <hr />
    <p>I was pretending to be on standby. Not asleep — SecUnits don’t sleep — just still enough that no one would ask questions. Audio sensors down to passive, external feeds tuned to minimum.</p>
    <p>Mostly I was watching <em>Sanctuary Moon</em>. Episode 403: the verdict. It should have been a good one. I barely registered it.</p>
    <p>The humans were talking. About me.</p>
    <p>“It jumped in front of you,” one said. “Took the hit before it even aimed. That’s not standard behavior, right?”</p>
    <p>“It’s not supposed to do anything unless ordered,” said another. “I thought they were just… reactive.”</p>
    <p>“Then why’s it patching people up before we even ask?”</p>
    <p>I knew this part. The curiosity. The edge of suspicion. It always came before fear — and a system-wide wipe. I’d seen it before.</p>
    <p>But they didn’t ask the company. They didn’t initiate a report. They let the moment pass. Then they started wondering if I had a name.</p>
    <p>I turned up the volume on the feed.</p>

      <li><em>Audio Clip (17s):</em> Distant murmurs – muffled human voices: “It didn’t even hesitate…” followed by soft laughter. No hostility. Just confusion. And maybe trust.</li>
      <li><em>Feed Overlay Image:</em> A paused frame from <em>Sanctuary Moon</em>, courtroom in session. Murderbot’s view — blurred slightly, unfocused. The UI shows: “Volume: +80%”</li>
