          <p>I keep thinking about what happened with Volescu.</p>

          <p>He was in full shock. Couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak. Just stood there shaking, his eyes locked on nothing. It was right after the creature attack—none of us were fully thinking straight, but he was frozen.</p>

          <p>Murderbot moved in. Not fast, not abrupt. He stepped in front of Volescu like a barrier and said, calmly: “You’re safe now. I can escort you to the transport.”</p>

          <p>Then, when Volescu didn’t respond, he said it again—same tone, slightly slower. His voice wasn’t flat, but it wasn’t performative either. It was… even. Reassuring.</p>

          <p>Volescu responded to that. He followed.</p>

          <p>I’ve seen plenty of bots handle crisis scenarios, but they follow the manual like clockwork. Murderbot adapted. He adjusted his timing, read the situation. He didn’t just <em>say</em> the right thing—he said it like he meant it.</p>

          <p>Afterward, I told him he handled it well. He just nodded and walked off.</p>

          <p>But I keep thinking about that moment. About the calm in his voice. The way he made Volescu feel safe—not just managed.</p>

          <p>I know it’s absurd, but part of me wonders if that was empathy.</p>

          <p>And if it was—where did he learn it?</p>
