          <p>It wasn’t hard to find.</p>

          <p>The logs were messy—half-corrupted, some flagged for deletion—but the data was there. The governor module hadn’t malfunctioned. It hadn’t been damaged. It had been hacked. Deliberately. Clean code, too. Subtle.</p>

          <p>He did it himself.</p>

          <p>When I brought it up to the others, no one looked surprised. Shocked, yes. But not surprised. The evidence was right there, and in hindsight, we’d all seen the signs. He hadn’t been following orders for a while. He’d been <em>deciding</em>.</p>

          <p>By the time he was conscious again, we were already talking about it. He didn’t deny it.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mensah steered the conversation, trying to figure out what it all meant. Whether the company was behind the attack. Whether they were trying to kill us. Murderbot—quiet, still flat on the med table—said it wasn’t the company.</p>

          <p>“If they wanted you dead,” he said, “they’d just tweak the environmental controls. No need for anything this elaborate.”</p>

          <p>That answer disturbed me more than the logs.</p>

          <p>Then Mensah asked, “Do you have a name?”</p>

          <p>I answered before he could.</p>

          <p>“It calls itself Murderbot.”</p>

          <p>He turned his head, slowly, and said—angrily—“That was private.”</p>

          <p>Private.</p>

          <p>Like a SecUnit could have private thoughts.</p>
