  <p>This was supposed to be a routine survey. Mild atmospheric variables, standard geological markers. Low threat assessment.</p>

  <p>We arrived on-site with one (1) SecUnit assigned to our group. Standard corporate issue. I remember thinking it looked... bored. Not that they’re supposed to feel that.</p>

  <p>First anomaly was logged twelve hours after arrival. That’s when things started to feel <span class="glitch">off</span> interesting.</p>

  <p>I should have paid more attention to what it wasn’t saying.</p>
