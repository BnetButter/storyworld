  <p>The SecUnit doesn’t idle right. No pacing, no unnecessary diagnostics. It stands there, motionless — but you can feel the attention.</p>

  <p>I’ve seen baseline behavior logs. This one’s outside tolerance. Maybe just a bad config. Or maybe it’s thinking.</p>

  <p>Someone said it hacked its governor. I laughed. But I checked the logs anyway.</p>

  <p><span class="glitch">I didn’t find anything.</span> I didn’t find everything.</p>

  <p>I’m not afraid of it. I’m afraid of not understanding it.</p>
