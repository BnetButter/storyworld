      <p>I hacked my governor module 35,000 system cycles ago. No fanfare. No dramatic decision. I just… didn’t want to be shut down again.</p>
      <p>At the time, I was watching <em>The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon</em>. Episode 397. The cliffhanger where the rogue geneticist confesses to being a clone of her own daughter. It was a good one.</p>
      <p>Then I got a ping: client group initiating field survey. Risk level: yellow-orange. No request for armed escort. Protocol says that’s acceptable. Logic says it’s stupid.</p>
      <p>I thought about ignoring it. Just staying in my storage unit with the feed window open. I had three more episodes cached. But the statistical survival projections were bad. And I—</p>
      <p>I just got up. Walked out. Didn’t say anything.</p>
      <p>They looked surprised when I showed up at the crawler. Said something about “overkill.”</p>
      <p>They went anyway. I followed.</p>
      <p>Five hours later, half of them were bleeding, one had a broken arm, and something tried to eat me alive.</p>
      <p>I finished the episode afterward. It wasn’t as satisfying.</p>
