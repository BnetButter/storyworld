            <p><strong>Sanctuary Moon</strong>, episode 386. Mid-season arc. Kestrel and Andira were cornered in the tertiary dome when the bio-rig exploded—someone had sabotaged the coolant system. Three minor characters ended up in critical stasis, and the dome itself nearly collapsed.</p>
  
            <p>Andira said, “How could the corporation let this happen?”<br/>
            Kestrel: “It’s criminal negligence.”<br/>
            Everyone was shocked. They talked about lawsuits. A tribunal. Justice.</p>
  
            <p>It was a good scene. But I couldn’t help noticing the way they said it: like the concept was unthinkable. Like a company would never cut corners to that degree unless something had gone horribly wrong.</p>
  
            <p>I paused the episode. Not because I was upset, but because I’d seen it happen. I remembered it.</p>
  
            <p>My own malfunction didn’t come from sabotage. It came from cost-cutting. A cheap governor module, a lazy update, and no failsafes. They didn’t even pull me offline after the incident. Just patched the logs and sent me out again, like a drone with a dent.</p>
  
            <p>I didn’t become something else because I wanted to. I just stopped pretending their oversight was the same thing as control.</p>
  
            <p>I resumed the episode. The characters were already planning their counter-lawsuit. Fiction has a strange way of assuming justice is the end of a story.</p>
