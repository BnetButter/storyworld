          <p>He’s gone.</p>

          <p>I knew he would be. Even before the medtech told me his bed was empty, I knew.</p>

          <p>I should report it. That’s the procedure. Flag the unauthorized unit, notify the company, send the logs. That’s what they expect from someone in my position.</p>

          <p>But I haven’t. And I won’t.</p>

          <p>He saved our lives. Again and again. He put himself between us and death more times than I can count. Not because he was ordered to. Because he chose to.</p>

          <p>He didn’t want to stay. And I understand that. Maybe more than I want to admit.</p>

          <p>There are people on the Preservation Council who would say this is a breach of ethics. That I’ve allowed a rogue unit to escape. That I’m compromising security.</p>

          <p>Let them say it.</p>

          <p>What I saw wasn’t a rogue. It wasn’t a malfunctioning bot. It was something—someone—trying to decide what it means to be free.</p>

          <p>And I’m not going to be the one who takes that away.</p>

          <p>So no. I haven’t reported it.</p>

          <p>I just let him go.</p>
