              Log Entry — MB Tactical Decision Review #4532 : Outpost Recon

          <p>They were discussing whether to investigate the other habitat.</p>

          <p>It wasn’t technically part of the contract. The data package didn’t include emergency protocols for external recon—just localized defense. But the possibility of another team being in danger was too big to ignore. Dr. Mensah brought it up, and the others started debating route options, comm risks, fallback plans.</p>

          <p>And then they started talking about going without me.</p>

          <p>That would have made sense. SecUnits are expensive, and sending me off-mesh with no clear threat present wasn’t technically efficient. I was supposed to do what I was told and not offer opinions unless asked.</p>

          <p>But I’d run a dozen risk models. And I’d seen what a few seconds of delay could cost.</p>

          <p>I said, “I recommend I accompany the team. I can scout ahead, and if anything happens, I’ll be able to provide immediate defense.”</p>

          <p>It went quiet for a few seconds. Then Mensah said, “That makes sense. Thank you.”</p>

          <p>That was it. No one questioned why I’d spoken. No one asked what authority I had to offer tactical advice.</p>

          <p>The truth is, I didn’t have any. I wasn’t supposed to.</p>

          <p>I wasn’t sure if speaking up was a violation or a choice. But I knew they wouldn’t have questioned me—because they didn’t know what I was anymore.</p>
