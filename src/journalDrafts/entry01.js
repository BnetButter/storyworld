    <p>The humans were talking about leaving camp early. Two of them thought Survey Site Theta had "structural anomalies." One thought it was "probably nothing." None of them requested security accompaniment.</p>
    <p>They didn’t know I’d hacked my governor module. That I didn’t technically have to listen to anything they said. They didn’t ask if I wanted to come. I didn’t wait for a directive.</p>
    <p>I rerouted my self-check subroutine. Preloaded additional medical gel packs. Checked the crawler manifest. Then I stood outside the crawler bay and waited until they noticed me.</p>
    <p>Someone said, “Do we need the SecUnit?”</p>
    <p>I didn’t say anything. I was already on board.</p>
    <p>The whole trip I stayed silent. Didn’t run any unnecessary diagnostics. Just kept one feed on them, one on the terrain, and one on <em>Sanctuary Moon</em> reruns. (Episode 399: the trial.)</p>
    <p>They didn’t know why I was really there. I didn’t either. Not exactly. But I had a bad feeling. And they didn’t know how many ways things could go wrong out there.</p>
