          <p>I didn’t say goodbye.</p>

          <p>I left a note. Addressed it to “my favorite human.” That felt accurate enough. I didn’t explain everything. Just enough.</p>

          <p>Leaving was the only option. If I stayed, I’d be something they thought they understood. A reformed construct. A case study in rehabilitation. Something <em>safe</em>.</p>

          <p>But I’m not here to be safe.</p>

          <p>I don’t know what I’m trying to be. I don’t even know what I <em>am</em>—beyond a SecUnit with a hacked governor module, a sarcasm problem, and more human media knowledge than is probably healthy.</p>

          <p>But if I want to figure that out, I can’t do it while pretending to be someone else’s property.</p>

          <p>So I left.</p>

          <p>I’m traveling light. No logs syncing. No ownership tag. I’ve wiped most of my traces. If someone scans me, they won’t find anything—no contract, no name. Just one more anonymous bot with nothing to declare.</p>

          <p>I’m a SecUnit with no mission, no orders, and no idea what I’m doing.<br/>
          So far, I’m doing fine.</p>
