              Journal Entry — P. Ratthi : Conflicted Log #77

          <p>We barely made it out.</p>

          <p>There was so much blood. The other habitat—whatever happened there, it wasn’t fast. The walls were scorched. The crew—what was left of them—looked like they tried to fight back. The smell alone made me sick. I think it’s still in my clothes.</p>

          <p>Murderbot was hit hard. Limbs half-functioning. One arm offline. I think Gurathin was the one helping him walk—half-dragging him back to the transport. He didn’t complain. He just kept scanning, every few seconds, like he didn’t trust the world not to fall apart again.</p>

          <p>When the doors finally sealed and we all started breathing again, he turned toward us and said, “You need to deactivate me.”</p>

          <p>He was calm. Not flat—just eerily composed.</p>

          <p>None of us knew what to say. I thought maybe he was in shock. Then he told us: an override module had been inserted into him. It was already active. He didn’t know how long he had—seconds, maybe less—before he lost control.</p>

          <p>“If I stay online,” he said, “I will kill you.”</p>

          <p>We didn’t move. I think some of us were trying to process it, trying to decide if it was true, or if we were even capable of doing what he was asking.</p>

          <p>And then, before any of us could make the call, he raised his own weapon and shot himself through the control module.</p>

          <p>The flash. The sound. I think I screamed.</p>

          <p>He collapsed instantly. Dr. Mensah rushed forward. Gurathin was already shouting for tools. I just stood there, watching hydraulic fluid pool around him, like something in a bad documentary.</p>

          <p>He did it to protect us.</p>

          <p>He could barely stand. He’d taken hit after hit to keep us alive. And in the end, he hurt himself so we wouldn’t have to decide whether to shut him down.</p>

          <p>I don’t know what he is. But nothing about that felt mechanical.</p>

          <p>We still don’t know what he is. But he didn’t want to hurt us. And we couldn’t treat him like something disposable.</p>
